## Ticket reading

The summary as recorded in the queue: Casting error when using SortedMapBackedCache.

## Code reading

DIH removed by a57ba25400. No SortedMapBackedCache code at head.

## History

- `a57ba25400`: named or touching the path in the B1 reading; ancestor of the pinned head: yes (checked).

## Reproduction attempts

Not attempted. The B1 scope ran no builds or tests.

## Gap analysis

The code reading shows the reported behavior no longer applies at the pinned head (fixed or removed), as described above.

## Verdict justification

close-obsolete: the feature or class the ticket names was removed, and the search at the pinned head finds no remaining use (cited in the code reading).

Missing for this verdict: The grep result is taken from the B1 reading; it was not re-run in this record.

## Limits

This record does not establish a reproduction. Commit linkage is by code path where the commit subject does not cite the ticket. It does not post anything to JIRA or GitHub.
